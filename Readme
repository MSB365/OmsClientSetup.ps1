I had to install on several servers the OMS Agent to manage the Systems in our Workspace. To go forward with this 
request I wrote this Script witch is doing the main work for me.

This Script is downloading and installing the OMS Client Agent and the Service Map Client.
During the Script you will be asked to Enter the OMS Portal credentials for your Workspace, 
this will be needed to register the Agent in your OMS Workspace.
